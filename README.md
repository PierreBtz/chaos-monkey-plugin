# Chaos Monkey Plugin

This plugin was written to help the development of a CLI tool interacting with Jenkins.
The need is to have a instance of Jenkins in a bad shape to gauge how the CLI handles it.

There are currently only 2 features:

* A latency injector, accessible from the Global Configuration of Jenkins:

* A queue locker accessible as a Global Action :

## Warning

This plugin is for testing and development purposes and should never be installed on a production instance!

# Plan

Another feature that will be needed is to simulate a heavy load on the instance.

## About the name of the plugin

It comes from the well known Netflix [Chaos Monkey tool](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey).
Thanks to Arnaud HÃ©ritier for suggesting it.
